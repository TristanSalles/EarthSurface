    - Drainage networks characterisation from stream order and patterns
    - River morphology and landforms: profiles, knickpoints and basin zonation
    - Geomorphic transport laws


The section focuses on the characterisation of fluvial systems. We will put the emphasis on specific landforms associated with river networks as well as the organisation of drainage basins and streams. Finally we will review some of the geomorphic transport laws that predict landscape form and evolution.

Drainage networks
------------------

Drainage networks display many types of quantitative regularity that are useful in analysing both the fluvial systems and the terrains that they dissect (Howard, 1967). Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in fluvial geomorphology. A drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

.. note::
  The fluvial dissection of the landscape consists of **valleys** and their included **channel** ways organised into a system of connection known as a **drainage network**. As such a river system can be considered as a network in which nodes (stream tips and stream junctions) are joined by links (streams). Stream segments or links are the basic units of stream networks.

    The **drainage basin** is the land surface drained by a **stream system**; an **interfluve** is a **divide**, an area of higher land that separates one valley from the next (within a drainage basin); a **drainage divide** is an interfluve that separates two drainage basins.

Stream order
*****************

Seen from above, river systems display a tree-like pattern, with many small streams feeding into fewer larger rivers and eventually into one very large river. **Stream order** is used to denote the **hierarchical relationship between stream segments** and **allows drainage basins to be classified according to size**.

.. image:: images/Strahler.png

   :alt: Stream order
   :align: center

Stream order is a basic property of stream networks because it relates to the relative discharge of a channel segment. Several stream-ordering systems exist, the most commonly used being the one devised by **Arthur N. Strahler**. In **Strahler’s ordering** system, a stream segment with no tributaries that flows from the stream source is denoted as a **first order segment**. A **second-order segment** is created by joining two first-order segments, a third-order segment by joining two second-order segments, and so on.

As shown in the figure above, **there is no increase in order when a segment of one order is joined by another of a lower order**. Strahler’s system takes no account of distance and all fourth-order basins are considered as similar.

.. note::
  Strahler’s stream order has been applied to many river systems and it has been proved statistically to be related to a number of drainage basin morphometry elements. Each higher order of stream is formed from the confluence of two lower order streams, and the watersheds of lower-order streams are included within the watersheds of higher order streams. **Orders 10–12 correspond to the main channels of large world rivers**. In general, individual streams get wider and longer with increasing stream order.


Drainage basin patterns
********************************

Most stream networks are adapted to regional slope and geological structures, picking out the main fractures in the underlying rocks. The high degree of conformity between stream networks and geological structure is evident in the main drainage patterns presented in the figure below.

    .. figure:: images/patterns.png
       :width: 100 %
       :alt: patterns
       :align: center

       Drainage patterns controlled by structure or slope (from Summerfield, 1991).

    - **Dendritic drainage** has a spreading, tree-like pattern with an irregular branching of tributaries in many directions and at almost any angle. It occurs mostly on horizontal and uniformly resistant strata and unconsolidated sediments and on homogeneous igneous rocks where there are no structural controls. **Pinnate drainage**, which is associated with very steep slopes, is a special dendritic pattern wherein the tributaries are more or less parallel and join the main stream at acute angles.

    - **Parallel drainage** displays regularly spaced and more or less parallel main streams with tributaries joining at acute angles. Parallel dip streams dominate the pattern. It develops where strata are uniformly resistant and the regional slope is marked, or where there is strong structural control exerted by a series of closely spaced faults, monoclines, or isoclines.

    - **Trellis drainage** has a dominant drainage direction with a secondary direction parallel to it, so that primary tributaries join main streams at right angles and secondary tributaries run parallel to the main streams. It is associated with alternating bands of hard and soft dipping or folded beds or recently deposited and aligned glacial debris. Fold mountains tend to have trellis drainage patterns.

    - **Radial drainage** has streams flowing outwards in all directions from a central elevated tract. It is found on topographic domes, such as volcanic cones and other sorts of isolated conical hills. On a large scale, radial drainage networks form on rifted continental margins over mantle plumes, which create lithospheric domes.

    - **Rectangular drainage** displays a perpendicular network of streams with tributaries and main streams joining at right angles. It is less regular than trellis drainage, and is controlled by joints and faults.

    - **Angulate drainage** is a variant of rectangular drainage and occurs where joints or faults join each other at acute or obtuse angles rather than at right angles.

    - **Annular drainage** has main streams arranged in a circular pattern with subsidiary streams lying at right angles to them. It evolves in a breached or dissected dome or basin in which erosion exposes concentrically arranged hard and soft bands of rock.

    - **Deranged drainage** forms on newly exposed land, such as that exposed beneath a retreating ice sheet, where there is almost no structural or bedrock control and drainage is characterised by irregular stream courses with short tributaries, lakes, and swamps.


River morphology and landforms
------------------------------------------

River long profiles, baselevel, and grade
********************************************

        :align: center

        River long profiles, baselevel and knickpoints (adapted from Bierman & Montgomery: Key Concepts in Geomorphology, 2014)

    The longitudinal profile or long profile of a river is the gradient of its water-surface line from source to mouth. Streams with discharge increasing downstream have **concave long profiles**. This is because the **drag force of flowing water depends on the product of channel gradient and water depth**. Depth increases with increasing discharge and so, in moving downstream, a progressively lower gradient is sufficient to transport the bed load. Many river long profiles are not smoothly concave but contain flatter and steeper sections.

    The steeper sections, which start at **knickpoints**, may result from outcrops of hard rock, the action of local tectonic movements, sudden changes in discharge, or critical stages in valley development such as active headward erosion.

    **Baselevel** is the lowest elevation to which downcutting by a stream is possible. The ultimate baselevel for any stream is the **water body into which it flows** – sea, lake, or, in the case of some enclosed basins, playa, or salt lake. Main channels also prevent further downcutting by tributaries and so provide a baselevel. **Local baselevels** arise from bands of resistant rock, dams of woody debris, beaver ponds, and human-made dams, weirs, and so on.

    **Grade** is a state of a river system in which controlling variables and baselevel are **constant**. A graded stream is one in which, over a period of years, slope is delicately adjusted to provide, with available discharge and with prevailing channel characteristics, just the velocity required for the transportation of the load provided by the drainage basin. The **graded stream is a system in equilibrium**; its diagnostic characteristic is that any change in any of the controlling factors will cause a displacement of the equilibrium in a direction that will tend to absorb the effect of the change. If the baselevel changes, then **streams adjust their grade by changing their channel slope (through aggradation or degradation), or by changing their channel pattern, width, or roughness**. However, as the controlling variables usually change more frequently than the time taken for the channel properties to respond, a graded stream displays a quasi-equilibrium rather than a true steady state.


Knickpoints
****************

As we saw above, rivers in equilibrium with the environment have smooth, concave long profiles, however a dynamic knickpoint, which is a sharp break in slope in the long profile of a river (*e.g.* a waterfall) can be formed when the system is perturbed by external factors such as changes in tectonic or climatic conditions.

Knickpoints migrate upstream, separating a downstream reach, broadly in equilibrium with the new conditions (red in diagram above), and an upstream reach which is yet to adjust (green in diagram). Understanding the development and migration of knickpoints through landscapes is therefore fundamental for inferring historic landscape forcings and predicting possible future landscape responses to change.

.. figure:: images/knickpoint.png
   :width: 85 %
   :alt: knickpoint
   :align: center

   Knickpoints (often waterfalls) are often located at dynamic boundaries within landscapes, separating a downstream reach characterised by steep channels and long steep hillslopes (highlighted in red) from a low relief landscape upstream (shown in green) (source: Waterfall3d model adapted from Hurst et al. (2012))

Knickpoints generally retreat very slowly through landscapes which makes the erosion processes very difficult to monitor in real time. Experimental flume tanks can allow these processes to be simulated in a controlled environment, as the timescale of knickpoint migration is reduced and the controls on formation and retreat processes can be isolated and quantified.


River landforms
********************************************

Most rivers are considered as reaches with different geomorphological characteristics. The most simple division generally made is to divide the river into **upper**, **middle** and **lower** river reaches.

.. figure:: images/ZonesFluvia.jpg
   :width: 90 %
   :alt: deathvalley
   :align: center

   Upper River: headwaters, Middle river: low gradient valleys and flood plains, Lower river: depositional zone (from T.L. Thornberry-Ehrlich, Colorado State University)


Upper river
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The uppermost portion of a river system includes the river headwaters and low-order streams at higher elevation. The upper river basin is usually characterised by steep gradients and by erosion that carries sediment downstream. Streams in this upper region are usually steep and torrential, and often include rapids and waterfalls. These streams generally have little floodplain, although part of the bank and surrounding land may be wetted during periods of high flow.

Middle river
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the middle course the river has more energy and a high volume of water. The gradient here is gentle and lateral erosion has widened the river channel. The river channel has also deepened. A larger river channel means there is less friction, so the water flows faster.

- As the river erodes laterally, to the right side then the left side, it forms large bends, and then horseshoe-like loops called meanders.
- The formation of meanders is due to both deposition and erosion and meanders gradually migrate downstream.
- The force of the water erodes and undercuts the river bank on the outside of the bend where water flow has most energy due to decreased friction.
- On the inside of the bend, where the river flow is slower, material is deposited, as there is more friction.
- Over time the horseshoe become tighter, until the ends become very close together. As the river breaks through, *e.g.* during a flood when the river has a higher discharge and more energy, and the ends join, the loop is cut-off from the main channel. The cut-off loop is called an oxbow lake.

Lower river
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The river channel is now deep and wide and the landscape around it is flat. However, as a river reaches the end of its journey, energy levels are low and deposition takes place.

Floodplains
^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the streams themselves, the depositional habits of fluvial systems produce striking landforms. Fluvial deposits are sediments deposited by the flowing water of a stream.

A floodplain is the relatively flat surface adjacent to the river or stream. During floods, when the stream overflows its banks, water flows over the floodplain and deposits sediment. Through fluvial processes, streams construct floodplains that accommodate their maximum flood capacity. Geomorphic features of the floodplain include:

- Natural levees—river may be immediately flanked by a buildup of sediment that forms natural levees. These provide some defense against flooding, but are occasionally breached in areas producing flood-plain splays—coarse fan-shaped deposit of sediment created during high flow events
- Oxbows and oxbow lakes—See below, features of a Meandering Stream Channel
- Point Bars—See below, features of a Meandering Stream Channel
- Terraces


Geomorphic transport laws
------------------------------------------

A geomorphic transport law is a mathematical statement derived from a physical principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused by one or more processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterised from field measurements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geomorphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state.

Relationship between river slope and drainage area
****************************************************************

As emphasised above, bedrock rivers play a important role in setting the boundary conditions for the relief production and its evolution. Of particular importance is the analysis of river profiles to detect those zones where rock uplift is high because rivers respond to tectonic forcing by steepening their gradient and enhancing their incision into bedrock.

   :alt: ksn
   :align: center

   Relationship between river slope and drainage area and plot of :math:`k_{sn}` along river streams using the Topotoolbox package.


The use of the normalised channel steepness index (:math:`k_{sn}`) which is derived from the slope–area regression, has widely been applied to detect zones subject to different rock uplift rates. This slope–area regression has the following form:

.. math::
  S = k_s A^\theta

where :math:`S` is the channel slope, :math:`k_s` is referred as the steepness index, :math:`A` is the drainage area (surrogate of stream discharge) and :math:`\theta` is the concavity of the longitudinal profile. :math:`k_{sn}` is estimated from the equation above by normalising the drainage area of a given reach and using a reference concavity (:math:`\theta_{ref}`) which corresponds to the regional concavity observed in reaches unperturbed by tectonic signals.


Relationship between valley spacing
****************************************************************

   Left: empirical relationship between the length of streams and the area of their basins based on the Hack's law. Right: empirical relationship between average spacing of outlets for major drainages and the half-width of major mountain ranges from Hovius (1996).

Defining :math:`S` as the average spacing of outlets for major drainages and :math:`W` the half-width of major mountain ranges, **Hovius** (1996) managed to fit a regression curve that yields to:

.. math::

   S = 0.46 × W + 0.798

Large-scale observations have allowed thorough comparisons across scales defining fractal  river basins [Mandelbrot,1977, 1983]. One outstanding example of fractal relationship is **Hack’s law** [Hack, 1957; Mandelbrot, 1983; Rigon et al., 1996] inferring the upstream length :math:`L_i` at a given position :math:`i` to the total cumulative area :math:`A_i` at that position, seen quite early as a signature of fractal geometry. With :math:`\beta` a constant between *1.4* and *1.7* and :math:`\alpha` comprised between *0.5* and *0.6* for natural rivers, Hack’s law scales to:

.. math::

   L_i = \beta A_i^\alpha
