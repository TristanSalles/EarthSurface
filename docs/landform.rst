Fluvial landforms & hierarchical organisation
=========================================================================

This chapter focuses on the characterisation of fluvial systems. We will put the emphasis on specific landforms associated with river networks as well as the organisation of drainage basins and streams.

Drainage networks
------------------

Drainage networks display many types of quantitative regularity that are useful in analysing both the fluvial systems and the terrains that they dissect (Howard, 1967). Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in fluvial geomorphology. A drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

.. note::
  The fluvial dissection of the landscape consists of **valleys** and their included **channel** ways organised into a system of connection known as a **drainage network**. As such a river system can be considered as a network in which nodes (stream tips and stream junctions) are joined by links (streams). Stream segments or links are the basic units of stream networks.

    The **drainage basin** is the land surface drained by a **stream system**; an **interfluve** is a **divide**, an area of higher land that separates one valley from the next (within a drainage basin); a **drainage divide** is an interfluve that separates two drainage basins.

Stream order
*****************

Seen from above, river systems display a tree-like pattern, with many small streams feeding into fewer larger rivers and eventually into one very large river. **Stream order** is used to denote the **hierarchical relationship between stream segments** and **allows drainage basins to be classified according to size**.

Stream order is a basic property of stream networks because it relates to the relative discharge of a channel segment. Several stream-ordering systems exist, the most commonly used being the one devised by **Arthur N. Strahler**. In **Strahler’s ordering** system, a stream segment with no tributaries that flows from the stream source is denoted as a **first order segment**. A **second-order segment** is created by joining two first-order segments, a third-order segment by joining two second-order segments, and so on.

As shown in the figure above, **there is no increase in order when a segment of one order is joined by another of a lower order**. Strahler’s system takes no account of distance and all fourth-order basins are considered as similar.

.. note::
  Strahler’s stream order has been applied to many river systems and it has been proved statistically to be related to a number of drainage basin morphometry elements. Each higher order of stream is formed from the confluence of two lower order streams, and the watersheds of lower-order streams are included within the watersheds of higher order streams. **Orders 10–12 correspond to the main channels of large world rivers**. In general, individual streams get wider and longer with increasing stream order.


Drainage basin patterns
********************************

Most stream networks are adapted to regional slope and geological structures, picking out the main fractures in the underlying rocks. The high degree of conformity between stream networks and geological structure is evident in the main drainage patterns presented in the figure below.

       Drainage patterns controlled by structure or slope (from Summerfield, 1991).

    - **Dendritic drainage** has a spreading, tree-like pattern with an irregular branching of tributaries in many directions and at almost any angle. It occurs mostly on horizontal and uniformly resistant strata and unconsolidated sediments and on homogeneous igneous rocks where there are no structural controls. **Pinnate drainage**, which is associated with very steep slopes, is a special dendritic pattern wherein the tributaries are more or less parallel and join the main stream at acute angles.

    - **Parallel drainage** displays regularly spaced and more or less parallel main streams with tributaries joining at acute angles. Parallel dip streams dominate the pattern. It develops where strata are uniformly resistant and the regional slope is marked, or where there is strong structural control exerted by a series of closely spaced faults, monoclines, or isoclines.

    - **Trellis drainage** has a dominant drainage direction with a secondary direction parallel to it, so that primary tributaries join main streams at right angles and secondary tributaries run parallel to the main streams. It is associated with alternating bands of hard and soft dipping or folded beds or recently deposited and aligned glacial debris. Fold mountains tend to have trellis drainage patterns.

    - **Radial drainage** has streams flowing outwards in all directions from a central elevated tract. It is found on topographic domes, such as volcanic cones and other sorts of isolated conical hills. On a large scale, radial drainage networks form on rifted continental margins over mantle plumes, which create lithospheric domes.

    - **Rectangular drainage** displays a perpendicular network of streams with tributaries and main streams joining at right angles. It is less regular than trellis drainage, and is controlled by joints and faults.

    - **Angulate drainage** is a variant of rectangular drainage and occurs where joints or faults join each other at acute or obtuse angles rather than at right angles.

    - **Annular drainage** has main streams arranged in a circular pattern with subsidiary streams lying at right angles to them. It evolves in a breached or dissected dome or basin in which erosion exposes concentrically arranged hard and soft bands of rock.

    - **Deranged drainage** forms on newly exposed land, such as that exposed beneath a retreating ice sheet, where there is almost no structural or bedrock control and drainage is characterised by irregular stream courses with short tributaries, lakes, and swamps.


River morphology and landforms
------------------------------------------

River long profiles, baselevel, and grade
********************************************

        :align: center

        River long profiles, baselevel and knickpoints (adapted from Bierman & Montgomery: Key Concepts in Geomorphology, 2014)

    The longitudinal profile or long profile of a river is the gradient of its water-surface line from source to mouth. Streams with discharge increasing downstream have **concave long profiles**. This is because the **drag force of flowing water depends on the product of channel gradient and water depth**. Depth increases with increasing discharge and so, in moving downstream, a progressively lower gradient is sufficient to transport the bed load. Many river long profiles are not smoothly concave but contain flatter and steeper sections.

    The steeper sections, which start at **knickpoints**, may result from outcrops of hard rock, the action of local tectonic movements, sudden changes in discharge, or critical stages in valley development such as active headward erosion.

    **Baselevel** is the lowest elevation to which downcutting by a stream is possible. The ultimate baselevel for any stream is the **water body into which it flows** – sea, lake, or, in the case of some enclosed basins, playa, or salt lake. Main channels also prevent further downcutting by tributaries and so provide a baselevel. **Local baselevels** arise from bands of resistant rock, dams of woody debris, beaver ponds, and human-made dams, weirs, and so on.

    **Grade** is a state of a river system in which controlling variables and baselevel are **constant**. A graded stream is one in which, over a period of years, slope is delicately adjusted to provide, with available discharge and with prevailing channel characteristics, just the velocity required for the transportation of the load provided by the drainage basin. The **graded stream is a system in equilibrium**; its diagnostic characteristic is that any change in any of the controlling factors will cause a displacement of the equilibrium in a direction that will tend to absorb the effect of the change. If the baselevel changes, then **streams adjust their grade by changing their channel slope (through aggradation or degradation), or by changing their channel pattern, width, or roughness**. However, as the controlling variables usually change more frequently than the time taken for the channel properties to respond, a graded stream displays a quasi-equilibrium rather than a true steady state.


River landforms
********************************************

Most rivers are considered as reaches with different geomorphological
characteristics. The most simple division generally made is to divide
the river into **upper**, **middle** and **lower** river reaches.

Upper river
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The uppermost portion of a river system includes the river headwaters and low-order streams at higher elevation. The upper river basin is usually characterised by steep gradients and by erosion that carries sediment downstream. Streams in this upper region are usually steep and torrential, and often include rapids and waterfalls. These streams generally have little floodplain, although part of the bank and surrounding land may be wetted during periods of high flow.

Middle river
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the middle course the river has more energy and a high volume of water. The gradient here is gentle and lateral erosion has widened the river channel. The river channel has also deepened. A larger river channel means there is less friction, so the water flows faster:

* As the river erodes laterally, to the right side then the left side, it forms large bends, and then horseshoe-like loops called meanders.
* The formation of meanders is due to both deposition and erosion and meanders gradually migrate downstream.
* The force of the water erodes and undercuts the river bank on the outside of the bend where water flow has most energy due to decreased friction.
* On the inside of the bend, where the river flow is slower, material is deposited, as there is more friction.
* Over time the horseshoe become tighter, until the ends become very close together. As the river breaks through, *e.g.* during a flood when the river has a higher discharge and more energy, and the ends join, the loop is cut-off from the main channel. The cut-off loop is called an oxbow lake.

Lower river
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The river channel is now deep and wide and the landscape around it is flat. However, as a river reaches the end of its journey, energy levels are low and deposition takes place.

Floodplains
^^^^^^^^^^^

The river now has a wide floodplain. A floodplain is the area around a
river that is covered in times of flood. A floodplain is a very fertile area due to the rich alluvium deposited by floodwaters. This makes floodplains a good place for agriculture. A build up of alluvium on the banks of a river can create levees, which raise the river bank.


Deltas
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/deltasp.png
   :scale: 37 %
   :alt: deltasp
   :align: center

Deltas are found at the mouth of large rivers - for example, the Mississippi. A delta is formed when the river deposits its material faster than the sea can remove it.



Hierarchical organisation
------------------------------------------

Characteristics of a river system depend on the landscape, climate, other geographical features and natural processes. Most river systems can be divided into different sections from the headwaters to the river mouth.

The physical characteristics of river systems are organised in a nested hierarchy, with physical processes operating at larger scales influencing those at successively finer resolutions, ultimately controlling the micro-scale distribution of hydraulic and sediment transport processes. The micro-, meso- and reach scales are therefore all equally critical elements within this hierarchy, with different geomorphic and ecological processes being relevant at each resolution.

   Left: empirical relationship between the length of streams and the area of their basins based on the Hack's law. Right: empirical relationship between average spacing of outlets for major drainages and the half-width of major mountain ranges from Hovius (1996).

Defining :math:`S` as the average spacing of outlets for major drainages and :math:`W` the half-width of major mountain ranges, **Hovius** (1996) managed to fit a regression curve that yields to:

.. math::

   S = 0.46 × W + 0.798

Large-scale observations have allowed thorough comparisons across scales defining fractal  river basins [Mandelbrot,1977, 1983]. One outstanding example of fractal relationship is **Hack’s law** [Hack, 1957; Mandelbrot, 1983; Rigon et al., 1996] inferring the upstream length :math:`L_i` at a given position :math:`i` to the total cumulative area :math:`A_i` at that position, seen quite early as a signature of fractal geometry. With :math:`\beta` a constant between *1.4* and *1.7* and :math:`\alpha` comprised between *0.5* and *0.6* for natural rivers, Hack’s law scales to:

.. math::

   L_i = \beta A_i^\alpha
