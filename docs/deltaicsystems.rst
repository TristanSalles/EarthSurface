Source-to-sink systems & stratigraphy
==========================================

Source-to-sink system
----------------------

When landscapes are eroded, the resulting sediment and dissolved constituents pass through a connected suite of geomorphic environments, ultimately to be deposited or precipitated on an adjacent flood plain, marine shelf or abyssal plain.

This journey from *source* to *sink* represents the return limb of a mass flux loop that begins when rock is first exposed to subaerial erosion by tectonic processes such as crustal thickening or volcanic processes. The suite of connected environments through which the journey takes place is the **source-to-sink** system.

.. important::
  The connected environments of the source to sink system are separated by dynamic boundaries that shift in response to changes in sediment fluxes and accommodation.

Each environmental unit, which is inter-linked with other units by the flux of sediment through the boundaries, may produce sediment through erosion or act as a sediment sink through deposition, either temporarily or permanently (*figure below*). The erosion and deposition occur at spatial and temporal scales that vary over at least four orders of magnitude, making system behaviour especially difficult to predict.

The source to sink system is a particularly important historical archive of past and present global change. Yet, whether we look at landscape morphology or the stratigraphy that records its erosion, we see the integral effect of many events over time.

An ability to predict the *quantitative behaviour* of the source to sink system is important for a variety of societal reasons. As an example:

1. The source to sink system contains most of our energy resources and potable water, and as a result most of Earth’s human population lives along the source to sink path.

2. Sediment eroded in uplands represents a significant loss of agricultural productivity even as it replenishes eroding coastlines. Yet we are presently unable to anticipate how perturbations in one part of the system will affect another.

To better understand and predict this system behaviour over an intimidating range of time and space scales, we rely on quantitative methods that help us analyse bed characteristics and architecture existing in the subsurface. Stratal patterns arising from the interplay of changing sea level, sediment supply, and accommodation can be predicted from physically based conceptual and numerical models that couple landscape-seascape experiments that reconstruct stratal geometries from ancient landscapes and climates.

Deltaic systems
---------------

In this part of the course we will focus on delta. Deltas are amongst the most environmentally and economically important coastal sedimentary environments. Significant resources (oil, gas, groundwater) have been exploited from deltaic formations.

.. note::
  The term **delta** comes from the Greek capital letter Δ and was first used for these deposits by *Herodotus* in the fifth century BC for the triangular-shaped alluvial deposits at the mouth of the Nile River.


Preamble
*********

Historically, modern deltas have been prized by human civilisations for their high natural and agricultural productivity, rich biodiversity, and for the abundance of waterways that provide easy means of transportation. Deltas are ubiquitous: 21 of the world’s 25 largest rivers, which deliver 31% of total fluvial sediment reaching the ocean, have formed well-expressed deltas at the coast (Meade, 1996). As a result, ~25% of the world’s population lives within deltaic and wetland coastal systems (Syvitski et al., 2005)

.. important::
  Deltas are *constructional coastal landforms* with both subaerial and subaqueous components that are genetically associated with rivers discharging into a standing body of water, such as a lake, estuary, lagoon, sea, or the open-ocean shelf (*Top video*: Landsat satellites images of the Wax Lake Outlet and Atchafalaya deltas from 1984 to 2014 EarthObservatory (Louisiana US, USGS-NASA).

A delta is usually built by a single river. Reworking of sediments accumulated at the river mouth by marine processes (e.g., waves, tides, currents) should be slow enough to allow delta building to proceed. Take a look @ the video below from MinuteEarth that explains how deltas are formed.

.. note::
  The river is the main source for sediment delivered to the delta, although in some wave-dominated settings, a significant portion may be transported by wave-driven currents from remote sources


Features description
*********************

The deltaic environment breaks down into three regions:

1. The **delta plain**: The terrestrial environment where river meets ocean. It differs from fluvial floodplains and channels because it develops on top of previous deltaic deposits. In it, we see: *distributary channels* / *flood plains* / *inter-distributary marshes and swamps* / *beach complexes*. The delta plain is really a coastal extension of the river system. It comprises river and overbank sedimentary deposits in a flat, meandering stream type of setting.  These environments are at or near sea level, and it is essential that the overbank regions receive repeated deposits of muds and silts during flood stages to build up the land surface continuously as the entire delta subsides below sea level by tectonic processes.

2. The **delta front**: The steeply sloping portion of the delta where deltaic deposits slope downward from sea level to the level of the sea floor. Characterised by: *thinly bedded turbidites* / *slumps, slides and convolute bedding* / *grain size grades from sand and silt near sea level to fine clay farther out*. During floods, however, sand may extend farther down slope. The delta front environment is an extremely sensitive environment. It is strongly affected by waves, tides, changing sea level, and changes in the flux or amount of sediment delivered to the delta front. Many delta fronts have an offshore sandbar, called a distributary mouth bar, or barrier island system, parallel to the coast along the delta front.

3. **prodelta**: is located in the subtidal to deep continental shelf environment. It contains mainly fine grained distal mudstones usually *finely laminated*.

Because the delta progrades, these environments are superimposed on top of one another.


Classification
***************

As mentioned above, deltaic depositional facies result from interacting dynamics processes (*wave energy*, *tidal regime*, *currents*, *climate*, *tectonic*), which modify and disperse fluvial clastic deposits. The complexity of environmental settings under which deltas exist results in a variety of vertical sequences that can form within the delta facies.

The morphology and sedimentary sequences of a delta depend on the discharge regime, the sediment load of the river, and the relative magnitudes of tides, waves, and currents. Also, the sediment grain size and the water depth at the depositional site are important for the shape of the deltaic deposition patterns. This complex interaction of different processes and conditions results in a large variety of different patterns according to the local situations. Wright and Coleman (1973) described depositional facies in deltaic sediments and concluded that they result from a large variety of interacting dynamic processes (climate, hydrologic characteristics, wave energy, tidal action, etc.) that modify and disperse the sediment transported by the river. By comparing 16 deltas, they found that the Mississippi River delta is dominated by the sediment supply of the river, whereas the Senegal River delta or the São Francisco River delta are mainly dominated by the reworking wave activities. High tides and strong tidal currents are the dominant forces at the Fly River delta.

Following these observations and based on the general morphology of the subaerial delta plain, deltas have typically been classified as **fluvial**-, **wave**-, or **tide**-dominated according to the dominant processes affecting sediment delivery, deposition, and dispersal (Galloway, 1975; Orton and Reading, 1993). This simple classification scheme was later extended to include grain size and other effects.


.. figure:: images/classification.gif
   :scale: 100 %
   :alt: classification
   :align: center

   The classification scheme after Galloway & Broussard (1975), where wave-, tide-, and river-dominated deltas are distinguished in the extremes of the triangle. By comparing 16 major river deltas, Wright and Coelman (1973) concluded that, in the extremes, the Mississippi River delta is the most river-dominated delta and the São Francisco River delta is the most wave-dominated one. The delta of the Fly River in Papua New Guinea is mainly dominated by the tides.


At the **river-dominated** end of the spectrum, deltas are indented and have more distributaries with marshes, bays, or tidal flats in the interdistributary regions. They occur when the stream of the river and the resulting sediment transport is strong and other effects, such as reworking by waves or tides, are minor. These deltas tend to form big delta lobes into the sea, which may have little more than the distributary channel, and have a levee exposed above the sea level. Due to their similarity with a bird's foot, they are often referred to in the literature as a *bird-foot delta*, like in the case of the Mississippi River delta. When more of the flood plain between the individual distributary channels is exposed above the sea level, the delta displays lobate shape.

**Wave-dominated** delta shorelines are more regular, assuming the form of gentle, arcuate protrusions, and beach ridges are more common (e.g., the Nile River delta or Niger River delta). Here, the breaking waves cause an immediate mixing of fresh and salt water. Thus, the stream immediately loses its energy and deposits all its load along the cost.

**Tide-dominated** deltas occur in locations of large tidal ranges or high tidal current speeds. Such a delta often looks like a estuarine bay filled with many stretched islands parallel to the main tidal flow and perpendicular to the shore line (e.g., the Brahmaputra River delta or the Fly River delta).


Delta stratigraphy
---------------------

Over time, research on deltas moved from the development of depositional models based on modern highstand deltas, which are ultimately controlled by variations in sediment supply by the delta-building rivers, to sequence stratigraphic interpretations of deltaic evolution through multiple sea-level cycles.

In 1890, American geologist G. K. Gilbert recognised that the deposition of finer-grained material farther away from the shoreline also created a distinctive vertical sequence in delta deposits. Based on these observations, he was the first to subdivide a deltaic deposit into three parts —the **topset**, the **foreset**, and the **bottomset**— where sedimentary processes are controlled by different physical processes.

   :align: center

   Top: sketch of stratification of a Gilbert‐type delta (from Chavarrías et al. 2018 after Gilbert, 1890). Bottom: view of a Gilbert‐type delta in the field (Arizona, US).

The topset deposit is formed out of layers gently inclined in the streamwise direction and deposited over the foreset by fluvial transport processes. The downstream limit of the topset is denoted as the brinkpoint. The delta foreset, or front, is dominated by avalanching processes and is formed out of steeply inclined layers that are placed over a fine‐grained bottomset deposit. In general foreset layers are nearly parallel to the relatively steep delta front, and the bottomset deposit is nearly parallel to the substrate (i.e., the lake or sea bottom).

a. the foreset layer is thus graded from coarse nearshore to fine offshore,
b. the bottomset layer consists of the finest material, deposited far out,
c. as this material continues to build outward, the stream must extend its length and forms new deposits, known as topset layers.

    :align: center

    **Foresets** are characterised by a depositional angle ranging between 25° and 30°, but they can reach 40° if the sediment is sufficiently coarse. Under these conditions, delta front is unstable and commonly affected by collapses, which can generate slumps, debris flow or even turbidity currents. **Toeset** deposits represent the transition between the steeply inclined foreset and the sub-horizontal bottomset. Because of the significant change in depositional angle, the larger rolling clasts along with several debris flow are trapped in the toeset zone, where also turbulent flows can drop part of their sedimentary load. **Bottomsets** are the finest deposits of the Gilbertian system. They are characterised by deposition of turbidity currents (HDTC and LDTC), although, being located (such as toeset) below the wave base, they are commonly interested also by mud settling (photo: Ghinassi).


Sediment transfer
**********************

The mode of sediment transfer from the subaerial delta plain to the subaqueous delta slope depends on the type and amount of sediment delivered by the fluvial system and the density contrast between the sediment-laden river outflow and the basin water.

.. figure:: images/delta_bates.png
  :scale: 75 %
  :alt: sediment transfer in delta
  :align: center

  Classification of deltas according to Bates (1953), considering the relationship between the density of the incoming flow (river discharge or Dr) respect to that of the receiving water body (lake or sea, or Dw). A) Hypopycnal flow（Dr<Dw) .B) Homopycnal flow (Dr=Dw). C) Hyperpycnal flow (Dr>Dw).

1. **Hypopycnal** outflow results in a buoyant plume of fine-grained sediment suspension that spreads away from the delta and gradually settles in its distal realm.
2. **Homopycnal** outflow involves rapid mixing of river and basin water, which causes sediment deposition close to the river mouth.
3. **Hyperpycnal** outflows plunge down on the steep delta slope, depositing there their sediment load.

The latter two types of river outflow conditions thus favour delta build-out, with most of the sediment deposited beneath the wave base and transported by gravitational processes.

Bottom: combination of these typical deposits in the field (photo: Ghinassi).


The stratigraphic architecture of deltas is the end-result of complex interactions among upstream catchment processes that regulate the location and magnitude of the fluvial sediment discharge, and downstream basinal controls that include the *shape and quantity of accommodation space* for sediment accumulation and the *type and energy of coastal processes* that redistribute these sediments. Together, all of these controls determine the mode and degree of partitioning of sediment between the delta and the wider receiving basin.

.. important::
  Gilbert-type deltas are sensitive coastal recorders of relative base-level changes. In zones of active tectonics in particular, the combined effect of eustasy and tectonic uplift/subsidence gives rise to diverse delta architecture.

The formation of such deltas reflects a high basin/river depth ratio; no scale is given, as the delta thickness depends on the basin accommodation and may range from a few metres to a few hundred metres. Bottom pannels: schematic cartoon portraying the growth of a Gilbert‐type delta subject to short‐term base‐level changes, with a sigmoidal toplap formed during base‐level rise (cases 1 and 3) and an oblique toplap formed base‐level stillstand or fall (cases 2 and 4). Note that the sigmoidal brink‐zone architectural record of base‐level rise tends to be erased by fluvial incision during a subsequent base‐level fall (see case 4).

Large changes in relative base level may lead to axial dissection of delta by an incised valley and its subsequent drowning with the progradation of a younger bayhead delta, or result in vertical stacking of successive deltas.
Low-magnitude short-term changes are recorded in the delta brink-zone, with the relative base-level rise reflected in a sigmoidal geometry and the relative base-level fall or stillstand in an oblique geometry.
As the brink zone tends to be eroded by fluvial system and waves, the foreset and toeset/bottomset deposits are the most valuable archives of allogenic and autogenic changes affecting the delta front and its fluvial feeder system.


Depositional sequences
**********************

.. important::
  A depositional sequence is defined as a relatively conformable succession of genetically related strata bounded by subaerial unconformities or their correlative conformities. These depositional sequences are bounded by subaerial unconformities. A subaerial unconformity is a surface formed through subaerial exposure and erosion, and includes features formed by downcutting rivers, soil processes, and karst processes.

A depositional sequence is the record of one cycle of relative sea level, that is, a fall and rise in relative sea level. As a result, depositional sequences have a predictable internal **series of surfaces** and **systems tracts**, which are suites of coexisting depositional systems, such as coastal plains, continental shelves, and submarine fans.

There are several models of systems tracts within depositional sequences. In this course, we will focus on what is called the **four systems tract model**. In it, a depositional sequence has four systems tracts, always in this order: **lowstand systems tract**, **transgressive systems tract**, **highstand systems tract**, and **falling-stage systems tract**.

.. figure:: images/systemtract.png

  Systems tracts and surfaces in the four systems tract model

These systems tracts are bounded by important named surfaces. The lowstand and transgressive systems tracts are separated by the **transgressive surface**, also called the **maximum regressive surface**. The transgressive and highstand systems tracts are separated by the **maximum flooding surface**. The highstand and falling-stage systems tract are separated by the **basal surface of forced regression**. The base of the lowstand and the top of the highstand are **sequence boundaries**, that is, subaerial unconformities and their correlative surfaces.


Systems tracts
************************************************

.. important::
  Sequence stratigraphy is concerned with the **relative** rates of change in sea level and sedimentation, not the position of sea level per se. Consequently, all of the plots shown below show the rates of relative sea level change (in blue) and sedimentation (brown). The horizontal gray line indicates a zero rate of change.

1. When the blue relative sea-level rate curve lies above the gray line, **relative sea level is rising**.
2. As the blue curve climbs upward, relative sea level is rising more quickly, and as the blue curve descends towards the gray line, **relative sea level is still rising but at ever slower rates of rise**.
3. The opposite is true when the blue curve lies below the gray line: as the blue curve falls below the gray line, **relative sea level** is falling at progressively faster rates, and as the blue curve rises upwards toward the gray line, sea level is falling, but at ever slower rates.

Sedimentation rate is depicted at always-positive rates, indicating that topography and climate are sufficient to supply sediment continuously. Although sediment supply is shown as a constant here, this is not a requirement; it only makes explaining the concepts of sequence stratigraphy easier.

.. important::
  Remember: these plots show the rate of change in sea level, not the position of sea level.


Highstand systems tract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/hst.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: hst
   :align: center

To understand the formation of a depositional sequence during changes in accommodation, it is easiest to start in the highstand systems tract (**HST**), that is immediately before the beginning of a relative fall in sea level. During this HST, relative sea level is undergoing a slow rise from the combined effects of subsidence and eustasy. Given the rate of rise in relative sea level, sediment supply is sufficient to outpace it, causing **progradational stacking**.

Because the rate of relative rise in sea level is progressively declining through the HST, the progradational stacking is initially relatively weak, almost aggradational, but becomes progressively stronger over time.


Falling-stage systems tract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/fsst.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: fsst
   :align: center

Through the HST, the rate of relative sea-level rise slows, and eventually, relative sea level will begin to fall, marking the beginning of the falling-stage systems tract (**FSST**). A relative fall in sea level has two important consequences.

1. First, a **subaerial unconformity** begins to develop. Rivers erode into underlying sediments, first at the highstand shoreline forming what is called an incised valley (not shown on the cross-section). These incised valleys deepen and lengthen seaward as relative sea level continues to fall, and they also lengthen landwards through headward erosion. Between these downcutting rivers, areas that had previously experience sedimentation on the coastal plain or shelf are now subaerially weathered. and become sites of soil formation. Note that because rivers are incised, there is no widespread fluvial sedimentation during the falling-stage systems tract.
2. Second, an **erosional surface** often forms on the shelf, as the sediment surface becomes perched above the equilibrium surface for waves. Much of this erosion occurs during storms. Once equilibrium is reached, marine deposition continues, burying this surface of forced regression. During a stepped fall in sea level, several of these surfaces of forced regression may form, but the first and lowest of these is called the basal surface of forced regression and it is what defines the base of the falling-stage systems tract.


Lowstand systems tract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/lst.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: lst
   :align: center


In the latter part of the FSST, the rate of relative fall begins to slow, followed by the beginning of a rise in relative sea level, which marks the start of the lowstand systems tract (**LST**).

As was true in the HST, the rate of relative rise in sea level is sufficiently slow that the rate of sedimentation outpaces it, causing **progradational stacking**. In addition, rivers begin to readjust their grade, starting the filling of the valleys cut during the FSST. In their seaward ends, these valleys can be flooded by the ocean, forming estuaries. Estuaries can be efficient sediment traps, preventing sediment from dispersing onto the shelf. Incised valleys are filled first at their downstream ends, and it may take a substantial amount of time, even into later systems tracts, for the upstream ends of the valleys to be buried. This buried surface of subaerial erosion and weathering is the sequence boundary.

Because the rate of relative rise in sea level increases throughout the LST, this progradational stacking becomes weaker and eventually approaches **aggradational stacking**.


Transgressive systems tract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/tst.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: tst
   :align: center

As the rate of relative sea-level rise increases, it eventually outpaces the supply of sediment, leading to **retrogradational stacking** in the transgressive systems tract (**TST**).

Retrogradational stacking is marked by well-developed flooding surfaces, that is, flooding surfaces with pronounced deepening. As a result, flooding surfaces within the transgressive systems tract are much more prominent than anywhere else in a depositional sequence. The first of these large flooding surfaces is called the transgressive surface, and it separates the underlying lowstand systems tract from the overlying transgressive systems tract. Also called the maximum regressive surface, it marks the most seaward reach of the shoreline within the sequence.

The rapid relative rise in sea level leads to the formation well-developed estuaries, and their trapping of sediment hinders the dispersal of sediment to the shelf. This starvation of sediment further promotes retrogradational stacking and commonly causes siliciclastic TST parasequences to be thin. This starvation of sediment also promotes the formation of features that indicate stratigraphic condensation, such as the formation of authigenic minerals, accumulations of marine fossils, unusually bioturbated horizons, and the formation of firmgrounds and hardgrounds.


Highstand systems tract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/hst2.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: hst2
   :align: center

The rate of relative sea-level rise slows through the latter half of the TST, and eventually the rate of sedimentation will again exceed the rate of accommodation, causing the return of progradational stacking in HST. The point of turnaround from retrogradational stacking in the TST to progradational stacking in the HST commonly corresponds to the most landward reach of the shoreline within a sequence. In most cases, it also marks the deepest-water facies within a sequence, and it is therefore called the maximum flooding surface.

Any remaining estuaries are filled with sediment during the HST, with rivers subsequently forming deltas that prograde out onto the shelf. This return of sediment to the shelf, after prolonged starvation during the TST, favours the development of progradational stacking.


Falling-stage systems tract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/fsst2.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: fsst2
   :align: center

The end of the depositional sequence is marked by the return of a fall in sea level and the formation of the next falling-stage systems tract.


Complete sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/complete.png
   :scale: 40 %
   :alt: complete
   :align: center

A complete sequence begins at one sequence boundary and ends at the next one; that is a complete sequence is bounded above and below by subaerial unconformities, which often correspond to substantial hiatuses. A complete sequence consists of four systems tracts, from bottom to top: lowstand systems tract, transgressive systems tract, highstand systems tract, falling-stage systems tract.

Although all four systems tracts will be developed in the sedimentary basin, not all will be present at any given spot. For example, falling-stage and lowstand systems tracts are commonly absent in depositionally updip areas. Likewise, transgressive and highstand systems tracts may be thin, absent, or difficult to distinguish in depositionally downdip areas. This spatial segregation of systems tracts that it is unusual to see all four systems tracts developed at one location, and it usually can occur only when the magnitudes of rise and fall in relative sea level are quite small. Expect systems tracts to be absent, but in a predictable way.

Experimental approach
**********************


Numerical approach
**********************



Shoreline trajectory
**********************

The shoreline or shelf margin trajectory is the path taken by the shoreline or shallow shelf margin facies as they change position when a sedimentary basin fills. These trajectories are controlled by rates of change in base level (as expressed by rates of change in accommodation, or the sum of eustatic change and tectonic movement of the substrate), varying rates of sediment accumulation, and the slope and shape of the basin margin and floor and their depths. Evolving geometries of clinoformed margins have been used as standards to explain basin margin progradation. Essentially these trajectories are responsible for the retrogradational, progradational and aggradational stacking patterns.


The concepts of system tracts, shoreline trajectory and accommodation succession represent critical tools to the interpretation of shoreline and shelf carbonate and clastic sedimentary systems. It aids in the determination of the depositional setting of the component system tracts and enables the prediction of the extent and character of these sedimentary geometries, often at the same scale as the components of local hydrocarbon reservoirs. This enhances the stratigraphers ability to find, map and exploit hydrocarbon reservoirs more effectively.

Wheeler diagrams
**********************

The rate of change of accommodation (at the shoreline) and the rate of sediment supply are the primary factors controlling regression and transgression in the geological record, or retreat and advance of a coastal depositional system. We will discuss in this part of the module these three different concepts and see how they can be used to quantitatively assess numerical models of deltaic systems evolution.
