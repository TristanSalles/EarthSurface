Geodynamics research considers all aspects of Earth evolution to better understand our planet. Geodynamics considers the interaction of processes from atmosphere to crust and lithosphere to the deep Earth interior. Interaction between disciplines improves understanding of individual systems and Earth as a whole. Deep Earth and atmospheric processes influence both horizontal and vertical motions of the surface, including plate motions and the evolution of topography.

    :class: toggle

    - Recognise the broad tectonic controls on landform and landscape dynamics
    - Understand the creation of passive margins
    - Explore the tectonic setting and the influence of dynamic topography on Australia's landscape


Plate tectonics refresher
---------------------------

Plate tectonics is the grand unifying theory in geology. It gets that title because many topics in geology can be explained, in some way, by the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are composed of Earth’s crust and the uppermost, rigid portion of the mantle. Together they are called the lithosphere. Earth’s crust comes in 2 _flavours_: **oceanic** and **continental**.

Lithospheric plates move around the globe in different directions and come in many different shapes and sizes. Their rate of movement is **millimeters to a few centimeters per year**, similar to the rate that your fingernails grow. Motion between tectonic plates can be **divergent**, **convergent**, or **transform**.


.. important::
  In divergent boundaries plates are moving away from each other, in convergent boundaries plates are moving toward each other, and in transform boundaries plates are sliding past each other. The type of crust on each plate determines the geologic behaviour of the boundary (see figure below).

   These models show 6 main types of plate tectonic boundaries. Blue indicates ocean, green indicates land, brown indicates the lithosphere, and orange is the asthenosphere. The bold arrows on the plates indicate their relative motion. Also shown are gray volcanoes. Ocean-ocean transform boundaries (not shown) exist on a small scale associated with spreading at mid-ocean ridges, and continent-ocean transform and divergent boundaries are rare (former) or don’t exist (latter).
