Tectonics, passive margins & dynamic topography
=================================================

Preamble
----------------------

Geodynamics research considers all aspects of Earth evolution to better understand our planet. Geodynamics considers the interaction of processes from atmosphere to crust and lithosphere to the deep Earth interior. Interaction between disciplines improves understanding of individual systems and Earth as a whole. Deep Earth and atmospheric processes influence both horizontal and vertical motions of the surface, including plate motions and the evolution of topography.


Recognise the broad tectonic controls on landform and landscape dynamics
Understand the creation of passive margins
Explore the tectonic setting of Australia and the influence of dynamic topography on the east coast of Australia


Tectonic geomorphology is the study of the interplay between tectonic and surface processes that shape the landscape in regions of active deformation and at time scales ranging from up to millions of years.
