Tectonics, passive margins & dynamic topography
=================================================

Preamble
----------------------

Geodynamics research considers all aspects of Earth evolution to better understand our planet. Geodynamics considers the interaction of processes from atmosphere to crust and lithosphere to the deep Earth interior. Interaction between disciplines improves understanding of individual systems and Earth as a whole. Deep Earth and atmospheric processes influence both horizontal and vertical motions of the surface, including plate motions and the evolution of topography.

Plate tectonics refresher
---------------------------

Plate tectonics is the grand unifying theory in geology. It gets that title because many topics in geology can be explained, in some way, by the movement of tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are composed of Earth’s crust and the uppermost, rigid portion of the mantle. Together they are called the lithosphere. Earth’s crust comes in 2 _flavours_: **oceanic** and **continental**.
