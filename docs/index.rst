   Generated 2D cross-section of a deltaic system under the influence of long-term sea-level change.

.. note::
  Focussing on source-to-sink systems and sedimentary basins evolution with practical applications to deltaic systems stratigraphy, stratal stacking patterns, shoreline trajectories and systems tracts.
