Aeolian sedimentary processes involve transport and deposition of material by the wind. The whole of the surface of the globe is affected by the wind to varying degrees, but aeolian deposits are only dominant in a relatively restricted range of settings. The most obvious aeolian environments are the large sandy deserts in hot, dry areas of continents, but there are significant accumulations of wind-borne material associated with sandy beaches and periglacial sand flats.

Global wind patterns

        The distribution of high- and low-pressure belts at different latitudes creates wind patterns that are deflected by the Coriolis force.

    Air masses move from areas of high pressure towards areas of low pressure, and the speed at which the air moves will be determined by the **pressure difference**. The circulation of air in the atmosphere is ultimately driven by **temperature differences**. The main contrast in temperature is between the Equator, which receives the most energy from the Sun, and the poles, which receive the least. Heat is transferred between these regions by air movement. Hot air at the Equator rises, while cold air at the poles sinks, so the overall pattern is for a circulation cell to be set up with the warm air from the Equator travelling at high altitudes towards the poles and a complementary movement of cold air back to the Equator closer to ground level.

    This simple pattern is, however, complicated by two other factors:

    1. the **circulation pattern breaks up into smaller cells**, three in each hemisphere.
    2. the **Coriolis force** deflects the pathway of the air mass from simple north–south directions. The result is the pattern of winds shown in the above figure.

        Arid and hyper-arid regions make up approximately 20% of Earth’s surface and are arranged in two latitudinal zones around 30°N and S of equator, as a result of dry air associated with the descending arm of a Hadley Cell.


Aeolian erosion
**************************

Wind erosion is based on two distinct mechanisms:

1. **Deflation** which is related to small particles eroded from the landscape by wind over time, leaving larger particles behind to form a desert pavement (ground surface lowers);
2. **Abrasion** where particles carried by the wind blast larger features in the landscape, abrading their surface and wearing away the rock.

The source of aeolian sediment transported by deflation is made of seasonally arid ephemeral stream or river beds, floodplains and alluvial fans in arid regions of the Earth (also glacial outwash in colder periods of Earth’s history). The process varies based on **bed adhesion**, which will increase the **fluid threshold velocity** (*i.e.* wind speed at which saltation is initiated) and which is dependent upon soil moisture, clay content, vegetation, armouring or cementation. However, once grains have become entrained, bombardment of the bed liberates smaller grains, effectively reducing the threshold velocity. The trajectory of individual grains, then, is  dependent upon their size, mineralogy (density), the wind speed and bed form characteristics. Once the speed of the wind decreases suspension and saltation will cease. The wind speed at which saltation is halted is defined as the **impact threshold** (see above figure - left panel).

Aeolian transport processes
****************************

A flow of air over a loose grain of sand exerts a lift force on the particle and with increasing velocity the force may increase to the point where the grain rolls or saltates. The strength of the lift force is proportional to both the velocity of the flow and the density of the medium. Air has a density of 1.3 kg/m3, which is three orders of magnitude less than that of water (1000 kg/m3) so, whereas water flows of only a few tens of centimetres a second can cause movement of sand grains, much higher velocities are
required for the wind to move the same grains.

Winds of 55 m/s or more are recorded during hurricanes, but strong winds over land areas are typically around 30 m/s, and at these velocities the upper limit on the size of quartz grains moved by the wind is around a half a millimetre in diameter. **This provides an important criterion for the recognition of aeolian deposits in the stratigraphic record: deposits consisting of grains coarser than coarse sand are unlikely to be aeolian deposits**.

At high wind velocities silt- and clay-sized particles are carried as **suspended load**. This aeolian dust can become entrained in the wind in large quantities in dry areas to create **dust storms** that can carry airborne sediment large distances away from its origin. The dust will remain in suspension until the wind speed drops and the fine sediment starts to fall to the ground or onto a water surface. Significant accumulations of aeolian dust are relatively uncommon, but airborne material can be literally carried around the world by winds and be deposited in all depositional environments.

..  admonition:: Clasts transport
    :class: toggle

    Smaller clasts (0.01-0.1 mm, depending on wind shear velocity) are kept aloft temporarily, and will rejoin the bed load, often at high velocity;

    The impact of these clasts on stationary grains further downwind imparts energy that mobilises stationary grains as ‘splashed up’. Particles moved into the suspended load temporarily (called saltation, representing about  20-25% of bedload transport);

    Larger clasts will move (roll or slide) incrementally along the bed as a result of the continual bombardment by smaller clasts and wind stress (called creep).

Aeolian terrains

Deserts and ergs
****************************

.. important::
  A **desert** is a continental area that receives little precipitation: they are arid areas that receive **less than 250 mm/yr precipitation**. Areas that receive average precipitation of between **250 and 500 mm/yr** are defined as **semi-arid** and are not usually considered to be true deserts.

.. figure:: images/desert.png
    :width: 80 %
    :alt: distance of transport
    :align: center

This definition of a desert does consider temperature to be a factor, for, although the ‘classic’ deserts of the world today, such as the Sahara, are hot as well as dry places, there are also many dry areas that are also cold, including **polar deserts** of high latitudes.

The **shortage of water** limits the quantity and diversity of life in a desert. The **lack of vegetation** is an important influence on surface processes because without a plant cover detritus lies loose on the surface where it is subject to aeolian activity.

An **erg** (*Arabic for sand*) is an area where sand has accumulated as a result of aeolian processes. Ergs are prominent features of some deserts (deserts of Arabia, the Sahara and Namibia), but in fact most deserts are not sandy but are large barren areas known as *rocky deserts* (also called **Reg** – Arabic for stone).

Rocky deserts (such as the *Gibber plains* in Australia) are areas of deflation, that is, removal of material, and as such are not depositional environments. However, pebbles, cobbles and boulders that lie on the surface may subsequently be preserved if they are covered by other sediment, and these clasts may show evidence of their history in a rocky desert.

Aeolian bedforms
------------------------------

The processes of transport and deposition by wind produce bedforms that are in some ways similar to subaqueous bedforms, but with some important differences that can be used to help distinguish aeolian from subaqueous sands. Two groups are separated in this section on the basis of their size: **aeolian ripples and dunes**.

..  admonition:: So what did you learn?
   :class: toggle, important

   - Aeolian deposits occur mainly in arid environments where surface water is intermittent and there is little plant cover. Sands deposited in these desert areas are characteristically both compositionally and mineralogically mature with large-scale cross-bedding formed by the migration of dune bedforms.

   - Associated facies in arid regions are mud and evaporites deposited in ephemeral lakes and poorly sorted fluvial and alluvial fan deposits. Aeolian deposits are less common outside of desert environments, occurring as local sandy facies associated with beaches and glaciers, and as dust distributed over large distances into many different environments, but, apart from Quaternary loess, rarely in significant quantities.

   Characteristics of aeolian deposits

   - lithologies – sand and silt only
   - mineralogy – mainly quartz, with rare examples of carbonate or other grains
   - texture – well- to very well-sorted silt to medium sand
   - bed geometry – sheets or lenses of sand
   - sedimentary structures – large-scale dune crossbedding and parallel stratification in sands
   - palaeocurrents – dune orientations reconstructed from cross-bedding indicate wind direction
   - facies associations – occur with alluvial fans, ephemeral river and lake facies in deserts, also with beach deposits or glacial outwash facies
