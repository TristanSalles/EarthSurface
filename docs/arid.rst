Aeolian environments

  This chapter is mainly based on Chapter 8 of G. Nichols book: Sedimentology and stratigraphy (2nd ed.), 2009 (`link <http://usuarios.geofisica.unam.mx/cecilia/CT-SeEs/LA-N_Sys.pdf>`_).

Aeolian sedimentary processes involve transport and deposition of material by the wind. The whole of the surface of the globe is affected by the wind to varying degrees, but aeolian deposits are only dominant in a relatively restricted range of settings. The most obvious aeolian environments are the large sandy deserts in hot, dry areas of continents, but there are significant accumulations of wind-borne material associated with sandy beaches and periglacial sand flats.

    Global wind patterns
    **************************

        The distribution of high- and low-pressure belts at different latitudes creates wind patterns that are deflected by the Coriolis force.

    Air masses move from areas of high pressure towards areas of low pressure, and the speed at which the air moves will be determined by the **pressure difference**. The circulation of air in the atmosphere is ultimately driven by **temperature differences**. The main contrast in temperature is between the Equator, which receives the most energy from the Sun, and the poles, which receive the least. Heat is transferred between these regions by air movement. Hot air at the Equator rises, while cold air at the poles sinks, so the overall pattern is for a circulation cell to be set up with the warm air from the Equator travelling at high altitudes towards the poles and a complementary movement of cold air back to the Equator closer to ground level.

    This simple pattern is, however, complicated by two other factors:

    1. the **circulation pattern breaks up into smaller cells**, three in each hemisphere.
    2. the **Coriolis force** deflects the pathway of the air mass from simple north–south directions. The result is the pattern of winds shown in the above figure.

        Arid and hyper-arid regions make up approximately 20% of Earth’s surface and are arranged in two latitudinal zones around 30°N and S of equator, as a result of dry air associated with the descending arm of a Hadley Cell.

Aeolian transport processes
****************************

A flow of air over a loose grain of sand exerts a lift force on the particle and with increasing velocity the force may increase to the point where the grain rolls or saltates. The strength of the lift force is proportional to both the velocity of the flow and the density of the medium. Air has a density of 1.3 kg
m
3, which is three orders of magnitude less than
that of water (1000 kg m
3) so, whereas water flows
of only a few tens of centimetres a second can cause
movement of sand grains, much higher velocities are
required for the wind to move the same grains. Winds
of 55m s
1 or more are recorded during hurricanes,
but strong winds over land areas are typically around
30m s
1, and at these velocities the upper limit on
the size of quartz grains moved by the wind is around
a half a millimetre in diameter, that is, medium sand
size storms (Pye 1987; Nickling 1994). This provides
an important criterion for the recognition of aeolian
deposits in the stratigraphic record: deposits consisting
of grains coarser than coarse sand are unlikely to
be aeolian deposits.

At high wind velocities silt- and clay-sized particles
are carried as suspended load. This aeolian dust can
become entrained in the wind in large quantities
in dry areas to create dust storms that can carry
airborne sediment large distances away from its origin.
The dust will remain in suspension until the wind
speed drops and the fine sediment starts to fall to
the ground or onto a water surface. Significant accumulations of aeolian dust are relatively uncommon
(8.6.2), but airborne material can be literally
carried around the world by winds and be deposited
in all depositional environments.


Arid and semi-arid regions are distinguished on the basis of their annual precipitation sums and include:

Deserts with an annual precipitation sum <50 mm/year and devoid of vegetation,
Arid regions with 50-250 mm/year precipitation and sparse vegetation, and
Semi-arid regions with a precipitation sum of 250 to 500 mm per annum and a steppe savannah/prairie/pampa vegetation.
Most deserts and (semi-)arid regions occur between 10° and 35° latitude (e.g. Sahara desert, Kalahari desert), in the interior parts of continents (e.g. Australia, Gobi desert) and in rain shadow areas in fold belts (e.g. Peru, Nepal). Large parts of the arctic tundra receive less then 250 mm precipitation per annum and qualify as `arid regions' too. Figure 1 presents a sketch map of the desert areas of the world.

Important geomorphic processes in the dry regions of the world differ from those in more humid environments:

streams are intermittent or ephemeral (and have very irregular discharges),
mass-wasting processes and unconfined sheet floods are prominent,
many rivers do not debauch into the sea but end in inland depressions without outlet,
salt lakes are a common landscape feature,
aeolian processes play an important role, particularly in areas below the 150 mm/year isohyet, and
physical weathering processes are prominent whereas hydrolysis of minerals is subdued.
Polar and subtropical fronts have shifted southwards in the (geologically) recent past and many regions that are arid today once had a more humid climate. Conversely, many of the present humid regions were much drier in glacial periods, especially between 20,000 and 13,000 BP when aeolian processes influenced land formation more than at present.

Mass wasting, fluvial processes and aeolian processes are the most important landform-shaping factors in arid and semi-arid regions. This chapter will solely discuss mass wasting and fluvial and lacustrine landforms in arid environments; sandy aeolian deposits were treated in an earlier chapter and loess deposits will be dealt with later when the major landforms of steppes and prairie regions will be discussed.
