    - Continental glacial processes
    - Erosion, transportation and deposition induced by ice flow
    - Marine glacial sediment delivery and deposition  processes


Glacial geomorphology is the scientific study of the processes, landscapes, and landforms produced by ice sheets, valley glaciers, and other ice masses on the surface of the Earth.

These processes include understanding how ice masses move, and how glacial ice erodes, transports, and deposits sediment.

    - To understand the mechanisms by which ice masses entrain, move and deposit sediment;
    - To understand how *glacial* sedimentary bodies articulate with other components of sediment routing systems;
    - To consider the importance of the *cryosphere* in shaping the Earth’s surface and the pivotal role it plays in influencing many of its core functions

..  admonition:: The cryosphere
    :class: toggle

    The cryosphere is an all-encompassing term for those portions of Earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground. Thus, there is a wide overlap with the hydrosphere.

..  admonition:: Ice sheet
    :class: toggle

    An ice sheet is a chunk of glacier ice that covers the land surrounding it and is greater than 50,000 kilometers wide. An ice sheet is also known as a continental glacier (*e.g.* Antartic Ice Sheet or Greenland Ice Sheet).

..  admonition:: Ice shelf
    :class: toggle

    An ice shelf is a thick, floating slab of ice that forms where a glacier or ice flows down a coastline. Ice shelves are found only in Antarctica, Greenland, and Canada. Thicknesses of floating ice shelves range from 100 to 1000 meters.

..  admonition:: Permafrost
    :class: toggle

    Permafrost is ground that continuously remains frozen for two or more years, located on land or under the ocean.



Cryosphere in high mountain regions
*******************************************************************

The cryosphere (including, snow, glaciers, permafrost, lake and river ice) is an integral element of high mountain regions. Widespread cryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even in the ocean. Almost 10% (671 million people) of the global population lived in high mountain regions in 2010, based on gridded population data (Jones and O’Neill, 2016) and a distance of less than 100 km from glaciers or permafrost located in mountains areas as defined in the following figure.

Distribution of mountain areas (orange shading) and glaciers (blue) as well as regional summary statistics for glaciers and permafrost in mountains are presented in the above figure. Mountains are distinguished based on a ruggedness index (>3.5), a logarithmically scaled measure of relative relief. Eleven distinct regions with glaciers. Diamonds represent regional glacier area and circles the permafrost area in all mountains within each region boundary. Histograms for each region show glacier and permafrost area in 200 m elevation bins as a percentage of total regional glacier and permafrost area, respectively. Also shown in grey is the median elevation of the annual mean 0 degree Celsius isotherm calculated. The annual 0 degree Celsius isotherm elevation roughly separates the areas where precipitation predominantly falls as snow and rain.

Ice sheets interaction with Climate
*******************************************************************

Ice sheets play a central role in the climate system. They store significant amounts of fresh water and are the conveyor belts for transporting snow that accumulates on land back into the oceans. The figure below illustrates several of the processes taking place between ice sheets, solid earth and the climate system. These interactions have an internal variability but also affect the coupled ice sheet–climate response to external forcings on time scales of months to millions of years. The inlay figure represents a typical height profile of atmospheric temperature and moisture in the troposphere.

If the current warming of the climate continues, the ice sheets will respond at a yet unknown rate, with unknown consequences for the rest of the climate system.

How has the distribution of glaciers and ice sheets changed?
*******************************************************************

The current distribution of glaciers and ice sheets is very different to how these areas used to look in the past. Over the last 100 years land covered with ice has decreased considerably as the global climate has warmed.

The majority of glaciers receded in the last 200 years, although noticeably some gained in length in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There were very few glaciers increasing in length from 2010 to 2014 as these were among the warmest in recorded history. There is much concern that Africa will soon join Australia as a continent with no glaciers.

    Change in the amount of ice on South Cascade Glacier between 1928 and 2010.


The figure above shows clear evidence of the decline in the volume of ice from the South Cascade Glacier in the Cascade Ranges in Washington State, USA. This glacier is estimated to have lost half its volume of ice between 1959 and 2010.

In recent geologic time the trend in ice coverage was not one of recession. After closely examining glacial deposits in many locations, scientists have identified a number of ice ages in the last 200,000 years where ice levels were much higher than today. The most recent of these ice ages occurred between 21,000 and 18,000 years ago and it has been estimated that about 30% of the Earth was covered by ice. The average temperature of the Earth was at least seven degrees cooler and sea levels were considerably lower (as much as 100 metres) as water was frozen.

The figure below shows the estimated extent of global ice cover around 18,000 years ago. It is important to notice that the amount of ice in the Northern Hemisphere is double that of the Southern Hemisphere, and that only relatively small areas of the Australian Alps and Tasmania were covered by ice. At the peak of this ice age it is thought that ice covered 6000 square kilometres of the central plateau of Tasmania to a depth of 700 metres.

It is uncertain as to why these ice ages, as symptoms of significant climatic change, may have occurred at regular intervals in the Earth’s history. Scientists have speculated that this climate change could have been influenced by a number of natural causes including celestial cycle changes, volcanic activity, changes in atmospheric gas levels, ocean current changes and sun spot activity.
