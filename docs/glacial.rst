    - Continental glacial processes
    - Erosion, transportation and deposition induced by ice flow
    - Marine glacial sediment delivery and deposition  processes


Glacial geomorphology is the scientific study of the processes, landscapes, and landforms produced by ice sheets, valley glaciers, and other ice masses on the surface of the Earth.

These processes include understanding how ice masses move, and how glacial ice erodes, transports, and deposits sediment.

    - To understand the mechanisms by which ice masses entrain, move and deposit sediment;
    - To understand how *glacial* sedimentary bodies articulate with other components of sediment routing systems;
    - To consider the importance of the *cryosphere* in shaping the Earth’s surface and the pivotal role it plays in influencing many of its core functions
