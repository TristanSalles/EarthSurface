Fundamentals of landscape evolution modelling
---------------------------------------------


In this module we will focus on the main equations developed in landscape evolution models (LEMs). These models are quantitative tools used to simulate Earth surface processes and the evolution of the land surface. LEMs can be used to deduce whether hypotheses about landscape evolution are likely to be valid, by making quantitative predictions about their development.

Recent development of modules has extended process representation to include, for example, modules of dynamic vegetation growth, floodplain evolution, dynamic adjustment of channel width, representation of sediment grain size, and debris flows.

The Modelling Geomorphic Systems: Landscape Evolution chapter from D. A. Valters 2016 presents an overview of the current approaches used in landscape evolution modelling.

Drainage reorganisation at various scales
---------------------------------------------

Continental-scale drainages host the worldâ€™s largest rivers and offshore sediment accumulations, many of which contain significant petroleum reserves. Rate of sediment supply in these settings may be a signal of external controls (e.g., tectonics, climate) on landscape evolution, yet deciphering between these controls remains a major challenge in interpreting the ancient stratigraphic record.
In this module we will explore drainage reorganisation at catchment, regional and continental scales, we will discuss the role of tectonics and climates on catchment dynamics, drainage networks responses and subsequent landscape evolution.


Labs
-----


LAB 1: Role of climate change in drainage network reorganisation
******************************************************************

This lab is an upscaled version of an experimental model from Bonnet & Crave 2003. simulate mountain range formation by upscaling the analogue experiment presented in previous section. The example illustrates long-term landscape evolution of an active mountain range. It shows how the constant valley spacing, achieved at steady state on both sides of the range, is progressively shifted due to a precipitation gradient applied across the mountain belt.

You will apply different climatic conditions and perform morphometrics and hydrometrics analysis using Badlands to quantitatively evaluate the catchment dynamics.

LAB 2: Role of climate change in drainage network reorganisation
******************************************************************

Using Badlands, you will simulate the main processes responsible for the formation of the Grand Canyon. You will be able to modify the erosive power of the water flow, the hillslope coefficients and the climate/tectonic forces to see how different the Grand Canyon might have looked as it developed through different types of bedrock.

You will analyse the development and propagation of knickpoints within the main valleys for different initial conditions of fault activity.

LAB 3: Role of flexural isostasy in foreland basin formation
******************************************************************

Flexure of the lithosphere is a frequently observed process by which loads bend the elastic outer shell of Earth. Using Badlands, you will simulate how variation in elastic thicknesses of the underlying plate is controlling basin formation and test the feedback mechanisms between surface processes, sedimentation and flexure with a set of simple models.

It will give you some insights on large-scale geometry of the sedimentary infill as related to orogen tectonics evolution of foreland basins.
